## Future

For me, this is more of an experiment than anything else. I try a lot of things, a lot of things work, a lot of things don't and I find it fun to play around with this. I also try code that I don't really understand in other projects (not risky stuff ofc), try to follow code standards and slowly try to get better at writing good code. I'm still bad at it though. Basically, a lot of this is experimentation and I don't plan to stop anytime soon, but somehow or the other, the project is generally stable and works for my daily use and I look up words a lot.
